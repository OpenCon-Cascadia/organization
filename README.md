# OpenCon Cascadia
## January 11-12, 2019  

### What is OpenCon Cascadia?
OpenCon Cascadia is a free conference designed to foster the growth of Pacific Northwest communities that are making research and scholarship more open, inclusive, and reusable.  Inspired by the success and focus of the international OpenCon conference, this satellite event will realize the following interrelated outcomes:

* Community Building: We will showcase existing regional work and projects related to open data, open access, and open education. Our goal is to create connections between individuals and organizations operating in different domain areas, such as basic science researchers, computational scientists, students, funders, librarians, and academic administrators.  

* Problem Solving: OpenCon Cascadia will provide opportunities for individuals and organizations to identify technical and non-technical issues that impede the realization and impact of open science and scholarship, and design solutions that leverage the contributions of diverse perspectives.  

* Collaboration: The conference will include dedicated facilitation, time and space to find collaborators, brainstorm, and work on projects. It will be the start of ongoing work to build solutions together.  

### Stakeholders
OpenCon Cascadia will seek to engage individuals and organizations that are involved in  improving research, academic culture, or public access to scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to, technical, policy, education, and citizen-science type projects. Our core organizing committee already has representatives from Oregon Health & Science University, Portland State University, Oregon State University, the Gates Foundation, Code for Science and Society, and the Allen Institute for Brain Science.
